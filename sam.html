<h1>Sam Schwartz</h1>
<p class="intro">My name is Sam Schwartz. I am a Yorkshire Terrier currently living in Northern Virginia. I am very loyal and protective to my family, but I'm not the friendliest with other strangers. I went to a training class once. It didn't work out too well. Being adorable and cute is my main mission in life, however I have other missions too. These mainly consist of chasing squirrels, rats, and other rodents, eating all food whenever possible, and napping for most of the day. I also enjoy long walks in the cold.</p>

<div id="squirrels">
<h1 id="rodents">Squirrels, Squirrels, and more Squirrels</h1>
<p>I love chasing squirrels. I especially like to stalk them, and then take off in an all-out gallop, scaring my family as I go tearing down the street. It's great fun to me. I have never caught one yet though. I did once catch a baby mouse in our garage, but it was taken from me before I could really do some damage</p>

<div id="food">
<h1 id="meat">Food</h1>
<p>I enjoy eating a variety of foods. However, I do get picky sometimes about random things. For example, I hate popcorn. And I also hate grapes. And some other snacks. But I love meat and all sorts of meat and everything about meat. I can it at any time any day.</p>

<div id="Walks">
<h1 id="walking">Walking</h1>
<p>I enjoy walks, especially in the cold. I look forward to them every day, the colder the better. I like the feeling of the cold wind blowing through my thick hair. I hate it when it's hot out. I don't feel like walking much on those days. However, I dislike the rain more than the heat. I will probably pee on the floor of the house rather than step outside if it is wet.</p>
